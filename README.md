# Overview
>In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington data was wrangled by udacity and the original can be found [HERE](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data), [HERE](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data), and [HERE](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data).
>I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
>I wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
